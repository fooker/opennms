[[objectives-setup-core]]
== Objectives

* Installing all required OpenNMS {page-component-title} components including PostgreSQL on a single node
* {page-component-title} Core and PostgreSQL run with the default configuration which are not optimized for running in production and monitoring large networks
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
* As a result you will have JRobin as time series storage which persists RRD files on the local file system and is the default
endif::[]
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
* As a result you will have RRDtool as time series storage which persists RRD files on the local file system and is the default
endif::[]
* Login to the web user interface and change the default admin password

[[requirements-core]]
== Requirements

* Linux physical server or a virtual machine running a supported Linux operating system
* Internet access to download the installation packages
* Make sure DNS is working and localhost and your servers host name is resolved properly
* System user with administrative permissions (sudo) to perform the installation tasks
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
* When you are interested in running the services link:https://docs.docker.com/[Docker] you need additionally link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install[Docker Compose] for the service stacks from our examples.

NOTE: If you run Debian, you have to install and configure `sudo` yourself.
