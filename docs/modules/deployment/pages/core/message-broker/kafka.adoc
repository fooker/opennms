<1> Use Kafka for Remote Producer Calls (RPC)
<2> Connect to the following Kafka nodes and adjust the IPs or FQDNs with the Kafka port (9092) accordingly.
<3> Use Kafka as message sink

<5> Connect to the following Kafka nodes and adjust the IPs or FQDNs with the Kafka port (9092) accordingly.

NOTE: If you set more than one Kafka node as `bootstrap.servers` the driver will attempt to connect to the first entry.
      If that is successful the whole broker topology will be discovered and will be known by the client.
      The other entries are only used if the connection to the first entry fails.

.Apply the changes with restarting {page-component-title} Core instance
