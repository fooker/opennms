= CDP Discovery

The Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is a proprietary link layer protocol from Cisco.
It is used by network devices to advertise identity, capabilities and neighbors.
CDP performs functions similar to several proprietary protocols, such as the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), Extreme Discovery Protocol, Foundry Discovery Protocol (FDP), Nortel Discovery Protocol (also known as SONMP), and Microsoft's Link Layer Topology Discovery (LLTD).
The CDP discovery uses information provided by the #link:http://tools.cisco.com/Support/SNMP/do/BrowseMIB.do?local=en&step=2&mibName=CISCO-CDP-MIB[CISCO-CDP-MIB]# and #link:http://tools.cisco.com/Support/SNMP/do/BrowseMIB.do?local=en&step=2&mibName=CISCO-VTP-MIB[CISCO-VTP-MIB]#.

NOTE: Only nodes with a running CDP process can be part of the link discovery.
      The data is similar to running a `show cdp neighbor` command on the IOS CLI of the device.
      Linux and Windows servers don't have a CDP process running by default and will not be part of the link discovery.

The following OIDs are supported to discover and build the CDP network topology and are collected by the CDP Discovery Collector.

Generic information about the CDP process can be found in the CDP Information box on the Node Detail Page of the device.
Information gathered from these OIDs will be stored in the following database table:

CDP Topology Updater provides CDP OnmsTopology consolidating CDP data collected by CDP Collector only full bidirectional connections between two CDP supported devices become edges.
Node A and Node B are connected by an CDP edge if and only if there is a CDP MIB port connection in Node A to Node B and vice versa.
