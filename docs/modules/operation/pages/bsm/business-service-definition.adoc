= Business Service Definition

The status of Service Monitors and any kind of alarm can be used to drive the operational status of a BS.
A BS is defined with the following components:

* Business Service Name: A unique name used to identify the BS
* Edges: A set of elements on which this BS relies which can include other BS, or reduction keys.
* Reduce Function: Function used to aggregate the operational status from all the edges.
   Specific functions may take additional parameters.
* Attributes: Optional key/value pairs that you can use to tag or enrich the busines service with additional information.

Each business service can contain a list of optional key/value attributes.
Use these to identify or tag the BS, and may be referenced in other workflows.
These attributes do not affect the dependencies or the status calculation of the BS.

TIP: You can use attributes to filter BS in Ops Board dashlets.

Use the Business Service Editor to manage and model the business services and their hierarchy.
You must have administrative permissions, available in "Login Name -> Configure OpenNMS -> Manage Business Services" in the Service Monitoring section.
